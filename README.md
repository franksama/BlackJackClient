BlackJackClient
============

My first Android application that connects to the BlackJack Distributed Server.  The backend consists of multiple servers that provide a fail safe environment.  Each server can be brought down and back up while maintaining consistent data across all servers.  
The BlackJackClient is an Android application that lets users play BlackJack on their mobile devices with up to 3 other players.
